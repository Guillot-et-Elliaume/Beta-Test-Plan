The user should also be able to cancel the date or the match.      | Medium                         | -                                                                                          |
| Potential matches preferences                         | A user should have the possibility to edit various filters, to better target the suggested profiles. Examples of those filters are the height range, political stance or age range.                                                                                                                   | Medium                         | All filters will be accessible to the user instead of only a few, with the other paywalled |
| Editing an already setup date                         | Once a date has been setup, the user should be able to request changes to both the date and place, or simply cancel the date                                                                                                                                                                          | Medium                         | -                                                                                          |
| Choosing your favorite places to have dates           | A list of the user's favorite places to have dates must be displayed on its profile. The user should be able to add, remove and edit the ranking of those places in said list.                                                                                                                        | High                           | A maximum of 5 places can be selected                                                      |
